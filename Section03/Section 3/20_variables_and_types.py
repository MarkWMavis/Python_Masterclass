#There are a few rules for variable names:
#  - Python variable names must begin with a letter (either upper of lower case) or and
#    underscore _ character.
#  - They can contain letters, numbers or underscore characters (but cannot begin with a number)
#  - Python variables are case sensitive, so greeting and Greeting would refer to 2 different
#    variables.
#  - Variables are created when they are first attached to a value, using =.
#

greeting = "Hello there"
age = 38;

print(type(greeting))
print(type(age))
