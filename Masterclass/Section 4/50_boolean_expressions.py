# A Boolean expression is an expression that evaluates to 
#   either True or False.

# EXAMPLES:

# age >= 15   
# name == "Tim"

# We can use "not" to reverse a Boolean value

# not True = False
# not False = True


day = "Monday"
temperature = 30
raining = True

if day == "Saturday" and temperature > 27 and not raining:
    print("Go swimming")
else:
    print("Learn Python")
